- **Line Charts**: To visualize trends in attrition over time, revealing patterns in employee turnover.
- **Pivot Tables**: To segment employee data by education, work distance, business travel, and more.
  
## Actionable Insights
- **Gender**: Female employees had higher attrition rates, indicating the need for targeted retention programs.
- **Job Role**: Laboratory Technicians had the highest attrition rates, suggesting the need for role-specific engagement strategies.
- **Business Travel**: Employees who traveled frequently for business exhibited higher turnover, warranting a review of travel policies.
